#Title: Air Refresher IoT Project

#Description:
The Air Refresher IoT project is an open-source solution designed to improve indoor air quality and create a pleasant environment. This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, various sensors, and actuators to automate the process of refreshing the air in a room.

#Key Features:
1. Gas Level Monitoring: The project includes a gas sensor to monitor the gas level in the room. It provides real-time feedback on the gas concentration, enabling users to take necessary actions if needed.

2. Battery Level Monitoring: An analog pin is used to measure the battery level of the device, ensuring that the device operates within the desired power range. Users can monitor the battery level to ensure uninterrupted functionality.

3. Spraying Time Control: The Air Refresher allows users to set the spraying time for refreshing the air in the room. By adjusting the spraying time, users can customize the duration of air purification according to their preferences.

4. Interval Selection: Users can choose the interval between successive air refreshing cycles. The project offers pre-defined intervals of 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour, presented as radio buttons for easy selection. Additionally, users have the option to input a custom interval.

5. Web Portal Interface: The Air Refresher features a user-friendly web portal for configuration and monitoring. Through the portal, users can view the gas level, battery level, and selected interval. They can also reset the IP address if needed.

6. OLED Display: The project incorporates an OLED display to provide visual feedback. The display shows the battery percentage, IP address, and gas level, making it easy for users to access essential information at a glance.

The Air Refresher IoT project offers an effective solution for automating the process of refreshing indoor air, ensuring a pleasant and healthy environment. By leveraging the power of IoT technology, users can conveniently control and monitor air quality parameters in real-time. The project's open-source nature encourages collaboration and customization, enabling developers to enhance and adapt the system to meet specific requirements.
